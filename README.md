This is me trying to make something inspired by Silk, which is really cool. You should try it at http://weavesilk.com/. I just wanna try this as a coding challenge for fun.

I'm using the p5.js JavaScript library for drawing, referencing https://p5js.org/reference/.
Additional inspiration/reference came from the one and only Dan Shiffman from his incredible channel, The Coding Train: https://youtu.be/BjoM9oKOAKY (I have no reason to plug this. I just think he's that good).

_Try it out_: https://mbrubin.github.io/sewthread/
