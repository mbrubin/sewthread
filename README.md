This is me trying to make like a Silk 2.0, which is atn http://weavesilk.com/. I just wanna try this as a coding challenge for fun.

I'm using the p5.js JavaScript library, referencing https://p5js.org/reference/.

I'm also using TypeScript files to get "tooltips" for p5.js functions when working in Visual Studio Code.
