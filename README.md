This is me trying to make something inspired by Silk, which is really cool. You should try it at http://weavesilk.com/. I just wanna try this as a coding challenge for fun.

I'm using the p5.js JavaScript library for drawing, referencing https://p5js.org/reference/.

I'm also using TypeScript files to get "tooltips" for p5.js functions when working in Visual Studio Code.
