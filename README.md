This is me trying to make like a Silk 2.0, which is atn http://weavesilk.com/. I just wanna try this as a coding challenge for fun.

I'm using the p5.js JavaScript library, referencing https://p5js.org/reference/.

I'm also using TypeScript files to get "tooltips" for p5.js functions when working in Visual Studio Code.

_If on Windows, you can run the Node.js local server by running 'runserver.bat'. If not already installed, you need to install Node.js and then run the command 'npm install -g browser-sync' before executing 'runserver.bat'._
